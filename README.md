# Analysis of the Determinants of Stunting in the Bangsamoro Region

This project aims to understand the predictors of childhood stunting in an autonomous region in the Philippines called Bangsamoro. Stunting, or having a height below 2 standard deviations of the global average for a given age, has been associated with negative outcomes in children’s later years in life. For instance, longitudinal studies have found that stunted children are less likely to perform well in school and find good jobs as an adult (e.g., Martorell, et al, 2010; Grantham-McGregor, et al, 2007; Thomas & Strauss, 1997).  The global community has acknowledged the problem of stunting, for instance, by including intermediate targets in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. To significantly reduce stunting, it becomes important that governments identify how they can target the children who are in need of nutritional interventions. 


## About the Data

The analysis uses a dataset  called the Health Financing and System Assessment Survey for the Bangsamoro Region, which is collected by the World Bank HEAHN team. A total of 21,573 individuals were interviewed in 3,805 households between May and July 2019. Meanwhile, there are 6,314 children aged 0 – 59 months, which is the age group relevant to this project.  A two-stage cluster design is used. In the first stage, villages were randomly chosen from each province; and in the second stage, at least 40 households were selected from the selected village in the first stage. Only households with children aged 0 – 24 months were eligible for the interview. The dataset contains information on household and member characteristics, anthropometric measures, health beliefs, health-seeking behavior, and perception on causes and consequences of stunting. A factor variable tagging the stunted children is already available in the dataset.
